Little Lemon capstone project for the Meta Front-End Development program by Vedant Damhar

**IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO PEER REVIEWER (PLEASE READ)**

>The API link provided by Meta is BROKEN, and found out that I was not the only one experiencing this!! Therefore I had to make a mock API javascript file and hard code some dates. I had to look up how to make a function to mock a fetch API/data function, and then I implemented it my way so that I can write unit tests for it. The timeout is to simulate the actual delay an API would have
when fetching data.

>The dates for reservation are valid starting from Feb 21st, 2024 to March 3rd, 2024, please make sure you try them out.

>When you're running the test files, please make sure you run both the api and form test.
